# Chiral
### Chiral investigates how polarized field interact with structures with chirality
For more on structure chirality and related optical activity, check this [link](https://chemed.chem.purdue.edu/genchem/topicreview/bp/1organic/chirality.html )

## addLayer
> Builds the layer with chirality
By taking a user-defined 'prob' value, the program randomly adds blocks on a matrix of size m*n.

## augment_data
> What is the point of augmenting the data? What is the matrix rot 90 doing??
> 
## base
> Builds up the model and does FDTD
The matlab program was auto-generated by using
### side note
ewfd and ewfd2 stands for fields of different chiralities

## collect_averageC_data
> C in the name stands for 'chirality'. More on electromagnetic chirality:[link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41377-020-00367-8) The program takes the result (electric and magneric field profiles) from the basemodel FDTD results and calculate the average chirality (chirality = $\overrightarrow{\E} \cdot \overrightarrow{\B}$). 

## convertLinearMatrices
> For doing Principle Value Decomposition. [link to more on PVD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis)
PVD allows us to find out the most "important" eigen-vector/dimension of a set of "chaotic" system.
Where was it called tho? To facilitate ML process?

## ensemnble_base_0
> The program trains CNN keras to find the field profile given optical structures. Built on top fo the TensorFlow platform, Keras is an API for a neural network doing machine learning.
